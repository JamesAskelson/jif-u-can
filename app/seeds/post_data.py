I walked into a bbq joint to pick an order up and I mentioned how good it smelled in the place and how i wish I had time to stay and eat. The man says hold on. He comes back with this pulled pork sandwich and COLE slaw and said 'on the house. No one should have to smell my good ass food and not be able to try it'. So now I have lunch and luckily I found 5 mins to pull over and eat it. What a legend.",
